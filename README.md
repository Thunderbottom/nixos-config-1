### Hostnames

I'm a big fan of [Brandon Sanderson], so that's where all of my hostnames come
from (see [`hostnames`](./hostnames)). They were manually copy-pasted from throughout the
[Coppermind] wiki and are [planets, shards], general terms, worldhoppers, and
[locations] throughout his works. Any of these that had a space or apostrophe
were discarded.
